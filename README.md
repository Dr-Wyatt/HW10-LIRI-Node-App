# HW10-LIRI-Node-App

## Introduction

This is a Node.js app built to query to 3 API's, Spotify, OMDB, and Bands In Town, to obtain information in real-time based on commands.

## How it Works

For each API, there is a specific command to let the app know which API you would like to query.

* Spotify = spotify-this-song
* OMDB = movie-this
* Bands In Town = concert-this
* _Bonus_ = do-what-it-says (pulls from the random.txt file)

Using this app is pretty simple. The first input will be one of the command reference above, and the second input will be the name of what you would like to request. 
* Ex: 
```
node liri.js spotify-this-song never gonna give you up
```
* Please reference the included screenshots to get an even better idea of how to run this app, and what you should expect back
